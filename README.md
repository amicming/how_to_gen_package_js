- Every React / Node Application has a package.json file in application root folder.
- Let's add [package.json] (https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json)

- install node / npm if it is not installed. 
    - `brew install node` 
    - `brew install npm` (Note: Actually, node come with `npm`)

- Now creating the package.json file is as simple as running the `npm init` command.

    `npm init -y`
- Now you can see the `package.json` file created. 

- Here we passed `-y` argument with `npm init`, So it will not asked `name`, `version` .. ..  details. It will take default.
